# Storage

This layer serves as the **persistent memory** of your knowledge base. It combines **vector store plugins** for storing embeddings used in semantic queries, and **file storage plugins** for retaining both raw and processed content. By unifying these capabilities, Unbody ensures that everything from AI-augmented data to user uploads remain accessible in a consistent, knowledge-centric manner.
