# API & SDKs

This layer provides programmatic access to your knowledge base and pipeline configurations. It includes read-only APIs for querying enriched content, admin APIs for managing sources and pipelines, and push APIs for submitting new data. SDKs make it easy to integrate Unbody into apps and developer workflows with typed, language-specific interfaces.
